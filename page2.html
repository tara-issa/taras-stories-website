            <h2>Volunteering in Bali</h2>
            <p>
                I volunteered with IVHQ in Bali, renovating schools in Soe. It was a short, meaningful journey, working together with the local community to improve the schools. The experience was filled with shared laughter, hard work, and cultural exchange. Even though it was a brief adventure, volunteering with IVHQ in Bali made a lasting impact, emphasizing the importance of connections and making a positive difference.</p>
            <!-- Recommendations: 
When volunteering with IVHQ in Bali, plan ahead, embrace local culture, stay flexible, prioritize teamwork, learn basic local phrases, practice responsible tourism, document your experience, and stay connected for ongoing support. -->
